\title{Generate simulated count data with batch effects for npeaks}
\usage{
mzrtsim(npeaks = 1000, ncomp = 0.8, ncond = 2, ncpeaks = 0.05,
  nbatch = 3, nbpeaks = 0.1, npercond = 10, nperbatch = c(8, 5, 7),
  shape = 2, scale = 3, shapersd = 1, scalersd = 0.18, seed = 42)
}
\arguments{
\item{npeaks}{Number of peaks to simulate}

\item{ncomp}{percentage of compounds}

\item{ncond}{Number of conditions to simulate}

\item{ncpeaks}{percentage of peaks influenced by conditions}

\item{nbatch}{Number of batches to simulate}

\item{nbpeaks}{percentage of peaks influenced by batchs}

\item{npercond}{Number of samples per condition to simulate}

\item{nperbatch}{Number of samples per batch to simulate}

\item{shape}{shape for Weibull distribution of sample mean}

\item{scale}{scale for Weibull distribution of sample mean}

\item{shapersd}{shape for Weibull distribution of sample rsd}

\item{scalersd}{scale for Weibull distribution of sample rsd}

\item{seed}{Random seed for reproducibility}
}
\value{
list with rtmz data matrix, row index of peaks influenced by conditions, row index of peaks influenced by batchs, column index of conditions, column of batchs, raw condition matrix, raw batch matrix, peak mean across the samples, peak rsd across the samples
}
\description{
Generate simulated count data with batch effects for npeaks
}
\details{
the numbers of batch columns should be the same with the condition columns.
